# Mini Blockchain üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Mini Blockchain**! This program lets you experience how **Bitcoin mining** works with simple code. It‚Äôs designed for fun, and you‚Äôll learn how blocks are mined and rewards are earned!

### How Mining Works ‚õèÔ∏è

1. **Mining a Block**: To mine a block, you need to find the correct **nonce** (a number) that, when combined with the block‚Äôs data, creates a **hash** smaller than a specific target number. This is done using **SHA-256**, a special math function.
   
2. **Difficulty**: Mining becomes harder over time. After every even-numbered block, the **difficulty** increases by **1%**, which means it will take longer to find the right nonce. This keeps mining challenging.

3. **Block Reward**: When a block is mined, the miner earns a reward in **Bitcoin**. The reward starts at **50 BTC** but gets halved every few blocks (called **halving**), just like in real Bitcoin mining.

### Key Terms

- **Hash**: A secret code that represents the data in the block.
- **Nonce**: A number that miners adjust to find the correct hash.
- **Difficulty**: How hard it is to find a valid block. It increases every few blocks.
- **Target**: The number the hash must be smaller than to mine a block.
- **Block Reward**: The Bitcoin earned for mining a block. This decreases over time.

### Why Difficulty Increases

Instead of adjusting the difficulty based on how long mining takes (which would be too complex for this demo), we simply increase the **difficulty** by **2%** after every even-numbered block. This keeps things simple and fun, while still mimicking real-world Bitcoin mining.

### Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Difficulty increases by 1% every even-numbered block.
- **Halving Reward**: Block rewards start at 50 BTC and get halved.
- **Wallet**: Track your Bitcoin balance as you mine blocks.
- **Blockchain**: View the blocks you‚Äôve mined so far!

### How to Use

1. **Start Mining**: Begin mining new blocks.
2. **View Blockchain**: Check out the blocks you‚Äôve mined.
3. **View Wallet**: See your total Bitcoin balance.
4. **Wipe Blockchain & Wallet**: Reset everything and start fresh.
5. **Exit**: Close the program when you're done.

### How to Run the Code

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   
2. **Download the Code**: Copy the Python code into a new file, for example `mini_blockchain.py`.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where your `blockchain.py` file is located.
   - Run the program with the following command:
     ```
     python mini_blockchain.py
     ```

4. **Interact with the Program**:
   - The program will present you with a menu.
   - Choose options to start mining, view the blockchain, check your wallet, or reset everything.

Enjoy mining and exploring how blockchain works!
